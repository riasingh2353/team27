# Gathered close in tenuous firelight, and uneasy companionship.

Let me share with you the terrible wonders I have come to know...

## Ian Power
image coming soon

Ian Power can be described as the diva of the group, the Scary Spice of the respective Girls.  He's fiercly independent, but never fails to be the star of the show.  Nevertheless, even when times get tough and the Cart has been gutted to find a loose wire, he can keep his head on his shoulders and remaining steadfast, like the steady Libyan coast that sheltered Aeneas' crew from Hera's watery wrath.

Ian Power is credited with robot documentation on the website, out-of-pocket R&D expenses (currently totalling $4620), and paying off TAs to sabotage other teams' cameras in order to pressure Kirstin to push back lab deadlines.  He currently holds the titles of Lead SysAdmin, Supreme Schematic-meister, and the Party Bard.  His special skills include playing the Trumpet, uphill skiing, and playing the numbers round in the UK gameshow Countdown.

Ian Power has never been to Canada, and doesn't believe it really exists.
