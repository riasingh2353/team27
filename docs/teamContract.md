## Team Expectations

time to  review

* A 5 point system will be used by which other members will evaluate a member’s work. 
The rubric is as follows:

*Team Participation:*
	
* All team members understand their role in any given task
* The team leader should compile a list of tasks for each member to complete by lab deadline

* In order to include ideas from each team member, before each meeting every team member should list 1 or 2 ideas that they’ve come up (deadline is before the meeting starts)

* In team meeting, each person will be assigned to be an informal leader for a certain task based on how comfortable they feel with that task

* No task should be done by only one person

*Personal Accountability:*

* Team Members are expected to arrive at all meetings that have been scheduled and agreed upon for one week or more

  * In the instance that all other members feel that a team member’s work has been of substandard quality over a substantial period of time, *their Cornell ID photo will be set as the background of our Homepage*
