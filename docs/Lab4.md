# Lab 4

[Home](./index.md)

## Objective:
The purpose of this lab is to begin the process of enabling our robot with computer vision, which will eventually allow it to locate treasures within an arbitrary maze based on sight.  For this week, our team broke off into two groups to tackle the logic and hardware implementation off the robot, so that we could have better control of, and ease of access to, our new system.  This system, at the time of writing, is composed of:

### Materials

* Our Arduino Uno
* Two (2) DE0-Nano - Altera Cyclone IV Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)
* CMOS VGA OV7670 Digital Camera
* Pre-built VGA Adapter
* Additional Components as Needed
